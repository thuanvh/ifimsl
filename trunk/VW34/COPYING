Each major source code directory within VW compiles to a different
library, and contains a file COPYING which specifies the terms under
which the library may be used and copied.

The VNL directory contains code derived from the VXL project and has a
special license (see VNL/COPYING). All other directories contain code
licensed under the GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) --- see for
instance VW/COPYING.
